        <h3>Lyrics </h3>
        <p>I'm at war with the world and they<br>
        Try to pull me into the dark<br>
        I struggle to find my faith<br>
        As I'm slipping from your arms<br>
        <br>
        It's getting harder to stay awake<br>
        And my strength is fading fast<br>
        You breathe into me at last<br>
        <br>   
        I'm awake. I'm alive<br>
        Now I know what I believe inside<br>
        Now it's my time<br>
        I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life<br>
        Here (right here), right now (right now)<br>
        Stand my ground and never back down<br>
        I know what I believe inside<br>
        I'm awake and I'm alive<br>
        <br>
        I'm at war with the world 'cause I<br>
        Ain't never gonna sell my soul<br>
        I've already made up my mind<br>
        No matter what, I can't be bought or sold<br>
        <br>
        When my faith is getting weak<br>
        And I feel like giving in<br>
        You breathe into me again<br>
        <br>
        I'm awake. I'm alive<br>
        Now I know what I believe inside<br>
        Now it's my time<br>
        I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life<br>
        Here (right here), right now (right now)<br>
        Stand my ground and never back down<br>
        I know what I believe inside<br>
        I'm awake and I'm alive<br>
        <br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        <br>
        In the dark<br>
        I can feel you in my sleep<br>
        In your arms I feel you breathe into me<br>
        Forever hold this heart that I will give to you<br>
        Forever I will live for you<br>
        <br>
        I'm awake. I'm alive<br>
        Now I know what I believe inside<br>
        Now it's my time<br>
        I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life<br>
        Here (right here), right now (right now)<br>
        Stand my ground and never back down<br>
        I know what I believe inside<br>
        I'm awake and I'm alive<br>
        <br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up </p>

    <aside>
        <h3> About the Song</h3>
        <blockquote>"Tying in with 'Hero,' here's one about feeling like you're falling under from all the stresses of life. Even though you feel like everyone around you is trying to take your hope away from you, no one has the right to do that and you shouldn't allow those negative influences to weigh you down. Live what you believe and don't be afraid to stand up for your faith. The song is about the idea that every day you wake up, there's a war for our souls." </blockquote> <div>- John Cooper on <i>New Release Today</i></div>
