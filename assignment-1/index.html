        <h3>Lyrics </h3>
        <p>I'm at war with the world and they<br>
        Try to pull me into the dark<br>
        I struggle to find my faith<br>
        As I'm slipping from your arms<br>
        <br>
        It's getting harder to stay awake<br>
        And my strength is fading fast<br>
        You breathe into me at last<br>
        <br>   
        I'm awake. I'm alive<br>
        Now I know what I believe inside<br>
        Now it's my time<br>
        I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life<br>
        Here (right here), right now (right now)<br>
        Stand my ground and never back down<br>
        I know what I believe inside<br>
        I'm awake and I'm alive<br>
        <br>
        I'm at war with the world 'cause I<br>
        Ain't never gonna sell my soul<br>
        I've already made up my mind<br>
        No matter what, I can't be bought or sold<br>
        <br>
        When my faith is getting weak<br>
        And I feel like giving in<br>
        You breathe into me again<br>
        <br>
        I'm awake. I'm alive<br>
        Now I know what I believe inside<br>
        Now it's my time<br>
        I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life<br>
        Here (right here), right now (right now)<br>
        Stand my ground and never back down<br>
        I know what I believe inside<br>
        I'm awake and I'm alive<br>
        <br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        <br>
        In the dark<br>
        I can feel you in my sleep<br>
        In your arms I feel you breathe into me<br>
        Forever hold this heart that I will give to you<br>
        Forever I will live for you<br>
        <br>
        I'm awake. I'm alive<br>
        Now I know what I believe inside<br>
        Now it's my time<br>
        I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life<br>
        Here (right here), right now (right now)<br>
        Stand my ground and never back down<br>
        I know what I believe inside<br>
        I'm awake and I'm alive<br>
        <br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up<br>
        Waking up, waking up </p>

        <h3> About the Song</h3>
        <blockquote>"Tying in with 'Hero,' here's one about feeling like you're falling under from all the stresses of life.<br> Even though you feel like everyone around you is trying to take your hope away from you,<br> no one has the right to do that and you shouldn't allow those negative influences to weigh you down.<br> Live what you believe and don't be afraid to stand up for your faith. The song is about the idea that<br> every day you wake up, there's a war for our souls." </blockquote> - John Cooper on <i>New Release Today</i>
